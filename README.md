# RiemmanSum
This is a Java project I was working on that implements the functionality behind Riemman's Midpoint rule for calculating area under a curve.
The main feature of this program is that it illustrates how the Riemman's Sum becomes more accurate as more rectangles are taken.
As of now, the program does calculations for a function x^2. 
Also, there is no implementation of a definite integral calculator that determines the true area under the curve, although that can be easily implemented through leverage of the Apache Commons Math library.
With a little extra work, the functionality can be extended to calculating the area under a curve for any user-defined functions.
